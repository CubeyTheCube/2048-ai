# 2048-clone

This 2048 clone means to demonstrate the strength of [2048 AI](https://github.com/macroxue/2048-ai) with auto-play.
The clone and the AI act as client and server, where the clone contacts the AI for move suggestions and auto-plays
the moves until the game ends. See [2048 AI](https://github.com/macroxue/2048-ai) for more details.

For the orignal 2048 game repo, go to https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048.
